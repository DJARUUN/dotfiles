### How did we get here?

As many, I started with Neovim using different distros like NVChad, LazyVim, etc.
I just never really felt satisfied with the experience and had a hard time configuring anything.

That's why I decided to start from scratch and create my own configuration based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
This gave Neovim a whole new feeling for me when everything I had was chosen and configured by me.

That is how this config was born.

### Main points

This config is based on simplicity and coming away from path of just recreating IDEs in Neovim.
I wanted to create something different than just another IDE.

I wanted to create a config that is easy to use and that allows me to focus on what I want to do.
